## NBA Playoffs Web Scraping and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### ABOUT
#### This is my first web scraping project. The aim of carrying out this project was to practice web scraping. 
#### The project highlights the shift in team dominance and player dominance in the National Basketball Association (NBA) playoffs from 1982 to 2022.
### SUMMARY OF PROJECT
#### I used the Requests library in Python to send HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML. 
#### After extracting the necessary information (column headers and rows), I created a pandas dataframe and saved it as a csv file then I wrangled the data. 
#### I used Tableau software to visualize and explore the data.
